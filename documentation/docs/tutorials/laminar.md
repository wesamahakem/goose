# Observability with Laminar

This tutorial covers how to integrate goose with Laminar to trace your goose sessions and understand how the agent is performing.

## What is Laminar

[Laminar](https://laminar.sh/) is an open-source observability platform purpose-built for AI agents. It traces LLM calls, tool execution, and custom functions so you can debug, evaluate, and improve agent behavior.

## Why Laminar for goose

- High-signal traces for LLM calls, tools, and sub-agents.
- Replay any span in the Playground to compare prompts and models.
- Build datasets from production traces and run evaluations.
- Analyze trace patterns with natural language queries and dashboards.

## Set up Laminar

Sign up for Laminar Cloud at [laminar.sh](https://laminar.sh) or self-host Laminar from the [open-source repo](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr). Grab your project API key.

## Configure goose to export OTLP to Laminar

goose exports OpenTelemetry data over OTLP/HTTP. Point the exporter to Laminar and provide your API key as an authorization header.

### Laminar Cloud

```bash
export LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=lmnr_proj_...
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.lmnr.ai"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="authorization=Bearer ${LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY}"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT=10000
```

### Self-hosted Laminar

```bash
export LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=lmnr_proj_...
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="authorization=Bearer ${LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY}"
```

If your self-hosted instance does not require auth, you can omit `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`.

:::tip
If you do not see traces, try setting the endpoint to the explicit OTLP path, such as `https://api.lmnr.ai/v1/traces` or `http://localhost:8000/v1/traces`.

## Run goose with Laminar enabled

Start goose normally. With the OTLP environment variables set, Laminar will capture traces of your goose sessions and tool execution.
