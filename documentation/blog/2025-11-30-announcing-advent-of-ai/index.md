You've heard the buzz: AI is reshaping our work. Maybe you've tinkered with ChatGPT, or your company is pushing you to "level up." But between the hype and the endless tutorials, a gnawing question remains: how do you move from theory to building something real?

The answer is practice. Not just following steps, but creating, problem-solving, and learning by doing.

That's why we're launching [Advent of AI](https://adventofai.dev), a 17-day challenge series starting December 1st. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps or an advanced developer exploring AI agents, this is for you. Each weekday, you'll get a new, hands-on project designed to transform you from an AI spectator into a confident builder.

## Here's Your Mission

Step into the role of the lead AI engineer at a bustling Winter Festival. You're the go-to person when systems fail, and they're failing fast. Each day brings a new challenge from the festival community:

**Day 1:** Build Madame Zelda an AI fortune generator that can handle the growing crowd when her app crashes.

**Day 6:** Set up automated GitHub issue triage with CI/CD pipelines to manage the festival's overwhelmed bug tracker.

**Day 11:** Create an automated poster generator to free Elena from 8 hours of daily Photoshop work.

**Day 14:** Use MCP sampling to build a council of AI personalities that debate and vote on the perfect festival mascot.

**Day 17:** Deploy a cross-platform wishlist app using MCP-UI so vendors know exactly what visitors want.

You'll master core AI engineering skills like building gesture-controlled interfaces, data visualizations, multi-agent systems, and production deployments using goose. These foundational skills will prepare you to work with any AI agent. Complete all 17 days, and you'll have built a comprehensive portfolio showcasing everything from basic automation to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## Designed for All Skill Levels

**For Beginners:** Every challenge includes clear guidance and resources to get you started. You'll learn core concepts from the ground up in a practical, project-based way.

**For Advanced Builders:** Looking for an extra test? Each main challenge includes bonus objectives that push you further: optimizing for performance, adding complex features, or integrating with advanced tools.

## How It Works

1. **Daily Challenges:** Every weekday brings a new story-driven problem to solve
2. **Your Creative Solutions:** There's no single "right" answer - we want to see your unique approach
3. **Community Sharing:** Join the #adventofai channel on our Discord to share and collaborate
4. **Solution Videos:** We'll post our approach on YouTube the day after each challenge
